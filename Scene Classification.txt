This script converts Sentinel-2's 10m resolution Scene Classification Layer from an 8-bit per channel RGB TIFF (3x8-bit = 24-bit color) into an 8-bit single-band ENVI classification file. It precisely maps ESA's 12 color-coded classes (0-11) while preserving the original 10m resolution and WGS84 geolocation. The output generates two files: a compact .dat raster with class IDs and a metadata-rich .hdr file containing coordinate references and Sentinel-2's official class definitions. A validation plot confirms the 8-bit classification matches the input colors. This creates analysis-ready thematic data ideal for pixel-perfect land cover change detection in remote sensing workflows.
 Here's what it does:

Input Handling:

Reads a Sentinel-2 L2A classification TIFF (RGB format where colors represent classes)

Extracts and preserves the original coordinate reference system (CRS)

Classification Processing:

Uses official ESA color codes to reclassify the RGB image

Implements priority-based classification (water gets priority over other classes)

Handles edge cases (pure black pixels = No Data)

ENVI Format Output:

Creates a binary .dat file with class IDs

Generates a detailed .hdr file with:

Geospatial metadata (CRS, pixel size, map info)

Class names and colors

File format specifications

Visual Verification:

Displays the classification result with correct colors

Shows colorbar with class IDs

Verifies CRS preservation

Key Features:

Maintains exact geospatial alignment

Handles Sentinel-2's 12-class system

Produces ENVI-compatible files that can be directly used in GIS software
